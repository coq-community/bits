## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Bits
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-bits
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/bits.git
cd bits
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


## Origins

This library has been extracted from Andrew Kennedy et al. ['x86proved' fork][xprovedkennedy].
This link presently redirects to https://github.com/nbenton/x86proved repository.

The main paper for this project is [Coq: The world’s best macro assembler?][coqasm].

## Using the library

To import the main library, do:
```coq
From Bits Require Import bits.
```

An axiomatic interface supporting efficient extraction to OCaml can be
loaded with:
```coq
From Bits Require Import extraction.axioms8.  (* or 16 or 32 *)
```

## Organization

This library, briefly described in the paper [From Sets to Bits in Coq][bitstosets],
helps to model operations on bitsets. It's a formalization of
logical and arithmetic operations on bit vectors. A bit vector is defined as an
SSReflect tuple of bits, i.e. a list of booleans of fixed (word) size.

The key abstractions offered by this library are as follows:
- `BITS n : Type` - vector of `n` bits
- `getBit bs k` - test the `k`-th bit of `bs` bit vector
- `andB xs ys` - bitwise "and"
- `orB xs ys` - bitwise "or"
- `xorB xs ys` - bitwise "xor"
- `invB xs` - bitwise negation
- `shrB xs k` - right shift by `k` bits
- `shlB xs k` - left shift by `k` bits

The library characterizes the interactions between these elementary operations
and provides embeddings to and from the additive group ℤ/(2ⁿ)ℤ.

The overall structure of the code is as follows:
- [src/ssrextra](src/ssrextra): complements to the [Mathcomp][mathcomp] library
- [src/spec](src/spec): specification of bit vectors
- [src/extraction](src/extraction): axiomatic interface to OCaml, for extraction

For a specific formalization developed in a file `A.v`, one will find its
associated properties in the file `A/properties.v`. For example, bit-level
operations are defined in [src/spec/operations.v](src/spec/operations.v),
therefore their properties can be found in
[src/spec/operations/properties.v](src/spec/operations/properties.v).

## Verification axioms

Axioms can be verified for 8-bit and 16-bit (using only extracted code) using
the following command:
```shell
make verify
```

For 8bit, the verification process should finish in few seconds. However
for 16-bit, depending on your computer speed, it could take more than 6
hours.
