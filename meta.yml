  ## Origins

  This library has been extracted from Andrew Kennedy et al. ['x86proved' fork][xprovedkennedy].
  This link presently redirects to https://github.com/nbenton/x86proved repository.

  The main paper for this project is [Coq: The world’s best macro assembler?][coqasm].

  ## Using the library

  To import the main library, do:
  ```coq
  From Bits Require Import bits.
  ```

  An axiomatic interface supporting efficient extraction to OCaml can be
  loaded with:
  ```coq
  From Bits Require Import extraction.axioms8.  (* or 16 or 32 *)
  ```

  ## Organization

  This library, briefly described in the paper [From Sets to Bits in Coq][bitstosets],
  helps to model operations on bitsets. It's a formalization of
  logical and arithmetic operations on bit vectors. A bit vector is defined as an
  SSReflect tuple of bits, i.e. a list of booleans of fixed (word) size.

  The key abstractions offered by this library are as follows:
  - `BITS n : Type` - vector of `n` bits
  - `getBit bs k` - test the `k`-th bit of `bs` bit vector
  - `andB xs ys` - bitwise "and"
  - `orB xs ys` - bitwise "or"
  - `xorB xs ys` - bitwise "xor"
  - `invB xs` - bitwise negation
  - `shrB xs k` - right shift by `k` bits
  - `shlB xs k` - left shift by `k` bits

  The library characterizes the interactions between these elementary operations
  and provides embeddings to and from the additive group ℤ/(2ⁿ)ℤ.

  The overall structure of the code is as follows:
  - [src/ssrextra](src/ssrextra): complements to the [Mathcomp][mathcomp] library
  - [src/spec](src/spec): specification of bit vectors
  - [src/extraction](src/extraction): axiomatic interface to OCaml, for extraction

  For a specific formalization developed in a file `A.v`, one will find its
  associated properties in the file `A/properties.v`. For example, bit-level
  operations are defined in [src/spec/operations.v](src/spec/operations.v),
  therefore their properties can be found in
  [src/spec/operations/properties.v](src/spec/operations/properties.v).

  ## Verification axioms

  Axioms can be verified for 8-bit and 16-bit (using only extracted code) using
  the following command:
  ```shell
  make verify
  ```

  For 8bit, the verification process should finish in few seconds. However
  for 16-bit, depending on your computer speed, it could take more than 6
  hours.
